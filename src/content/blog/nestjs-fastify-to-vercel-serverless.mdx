In the world of modern web development, serverless architectures are gaining popularity due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness. This guide will show you how to convert your NestJS Fastify application into a serverless function that can be deployed on Vercel.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

1. An existing NestJS project using Fastify
2. Node.js and npm installed
3. Vercel CLI installed (`npm i -g vercel`)

## Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

First, let's install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @vendia/serverless-express
```

## Step 2: Modify Your Main Application File

Update your `src/main.ts` file to use Fastify and prepare for serverless:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core'
import {
	FastifyAdapter,
	NestFastifyApplication,
} from '@nestjs/platform-fastify'
import { AppModule } from './app.module'

let app: NestFastifyApplication

async function bootstrap() {
	if (!app) {
		app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(
			AppModule,
			new FastifyAdapter()
		)
		await app.init()
	}
	return app.getHttpAdapter().getInstance()
}

export default bootstrap
```

## Step 3: Create a Serverless Function File

Create a new file `api/index.ts` in your project root:

```typescript
import { Callback, Context, Handler } from 'aws-lambda'
import serverlessExpress from '@vendia/serverless-express'
import bootstrap from '../src/main'

let server: Handler

async function setup(event: any, context: Context) {
	const app = await bootstrap()
	server = serverlessExpress({ app })
	return server(event, context)
}

export const handler: Handler = async (
	event: any,
	context: Context,
	callback: Callback
) => {
	if (server) {
		return server(event, context, callback)
	}
	return setup(event, context)
}
```

## Step 4: Update package.json

Update your `package.json` to include build scripts:

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"build": "nest build",
		"vercel-build": "npm run build"
	}
}
```

## Step 5: Create a Vercel Configuration File

Create a `vercel.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"builds": [
		{
			"src": "api/index.ts",
			"use": "@vercel/node"
		}
	],
	"routes": [
		{
			"src": "/(.*)",
			"dest": "api/index.ts"
		}
	]
}
```

## Step 6: Deploy to Vercel

Now you're ready to deploy your NestJS Fastify app as a serverless function on Vercel. Use the Vercel CLI to deploy:

```bash
vercel
```

## Considerations and Limitations

When converting your NestJS Fastify app to a serverless function, keep in mind:

1. **Cold Starts**: Serverless functions may experience "cold starts," which can lead to longer response times for the first request after a period of inactivity.

2. **Statelessness**: Serverless functions are stateless, so you need to use external services for persistent storage.

3. **Execution Time Limits**: Vercel has execution time limits for serverless functions. Ensure your functions complete within these limits.

4. **Dependencies**: Be mindful of the size of your dependencies, as there are often limits on the total package size for serverless functions.

## Testing Locally

To test your serverless NestJS Fastify app locally, you can use the Vercel CLI:

```bash
vercel dev
```

This will start a local development server that simulates the Vercel serverless environment.

By following these steps, you've successfully converted your NestJS Fastify application into a serverless function deployable on Vercel. This approach allows you to leverage the benefits of serverless architecture while maintaining the structure and features of your NestJS application.

Remember to adjust your application logic if it relies on long-running processes or in-memory state, as these patterns may not be suitable for a serverless environment. Instead, consider using external services for tasks that require persistence or long-running operations.
